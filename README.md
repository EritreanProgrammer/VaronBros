## Welcome
VaronBros Community is a Discord server for Varon's YT Channel.

## Rules
There are three levels to our rule system.
1. Warning
2. Warning/Kick
3. Kick/Ban

Here are our current rules:

- Rule 1: {Level  3} No NSFW. 

- Rule 2: {Level 2/ Possibly Level 3} Don't be annoying/instigate drama. If someone is asking you to stop being annoying or doing something to them that just makes them mad, don't do it. 

- Rule 3: {Level 1} Don't backseat moderate this server. However, if something is wrong and it's important, notify the staff team immediately.

- Rule 4: {Level 2} When you are asking for a suggestion about the server in #varonbros-suggestions, please keep it polite. Negativity is condemned, and nobody does not like taking a spit in the face.

- Rule 5: {Level 2} Whoever asks to be staff will be warned, and repeated actions will result in a kick. (When joking, please clarify or make it seem obvious that you're trying to be funny or make a joke)

- Rule 6: { Level 1/2/3} Do not attempt to break the Discord ToS here. Self explanatory. https://discordapp.com/terms

- Rule 7: {Level 3} IP grabbing or threats is frowned upon, and such things will be taken to law enforcement, and not Discord.

- Rule 8 {Level 2} Be respectful. No matter who it is, your friend, your enemy, someone you don't know, just respect them. It's ok to fool around, but if the person doesn't find it funny, just don't be a pain in the butt to them. 

- Rule 9 {Level 1,2,3} Use common sense. Just because there isn't a rule here, doesn't mean it gives you the ok to do things that are unacceptable
